# Full-Stack JavaScript App 🚀

This repository contains a full-stack JavaScript application with a **React** frontend and an **Express** backend.

## Project Structure 🗂️

The project is divided into two main folders:

- **frontend**: The React application for the user interface.
- **backend**: The Express API handling server-side logic.

## Getting Started 🌱

### Prerequisites 🛠️

- Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation 📥

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
```
   ```

2. Navigate to the **frontend** folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Navigate to the **backend** folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application 🚀

Once dependencies are installed, you can run the application in development mode:

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend application**:
   In a separate terminal window or tab, navigate to the **frontend** folder and run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

This will start the React app and the Express server. The frontend should automatically open in your default web browser.

## Folder Structure 📂

### `frontend/`
Contains all the React code and assets.

- `src/`: All React components and logic.
- `public/`: Static files like `index.html`, icons, etc.
- `package.json`: The npm configuration for frontend dependencies and scripts.

### `backend/`
Contains all the Express server-side code and routes.

- `index.js`:It Contain all the logic for the video Transmission and Live Chatting
- `package.json`: The npm configuration for backend dependencies and scripts.

## Scripts 📝

- **frontend**:
  - `npm run dev`: Starts the React development server.
  - `npm install`: Installs frontend dependencies.

- **backend**:
  - `npm run dev`: Starts the Express server in development mode with hot reloading.
  - `npm install`: Installs backend dependencies.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript,VIte,socket.io-client
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js,socket.io-client





# Face, Number Plate & Gesture Detection

This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to perform real-time detection of faces, number plates, and hand gestures from a webcam feed.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed and install the required dependencies using:

```sh
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## How It Works
- **Face Detection**: Uses OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier to detect faces.
- **Number Plate Detection**: Uses OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier to detect vehicle number plates.
- **Hand Gesture Detection**: Uses MediaPipe's Hand solution to track hand landmarks and gestures.
- Captures video from the webcam and processes each frame to detect these elements in real time.

## Dependencies
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe (`mp.solutions`)

## Usage
Run the script using:

```sh
python model.py
```

### Controls
- Press `q` to exit the application.

## Features
- Real-time face detection
- Real-time number plate detection
- Real-time hand gesture tracking
- Webcam-based video processing

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure your webcam is properly connected and accessible.
- Haar cascade XML files for face and plate detection should exist in the correct path (`cv2.data.haarcascades`).
